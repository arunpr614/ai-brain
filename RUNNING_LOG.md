# AI Brain — Running Log

**Purpose:** Append-only project journal. Each entry narrates progress since the previous entry for an AI-agent audience. Read top-to-bottom to reconstruct the project journey.

**Rule:** never edit or delete prior entries. Append new entries below with `## <date>` headings. Corrections to earlier claims are made in the next entry, not by rewriting history.

**Related docs:**
- `BUILD_PLAN.md` — phased architecture + roadmap (prose)
- `ROADMAP_TRACKER.md` — feature sequencing by version
- `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` — tactical status board
- `DESIGN.md` — design tokens (getdesign.md spec)
- `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` — UX contract + acceptance checklist
- `FEATURE_INVENTORY.md` — Recall + Knowly feature catalog (source of truth for what to build)
- `STRATEGY.md` — historical strategy memo (pre-reopen)
- `PROJECT_CLOSURE.md` — historical; project was closed, then re-opened 2026-05-07
- `docs/research/` — research spike outputs

## 2026-05-07 14:00 — Project re-opened; planning scaffolding + design + research spikes

**Entry author:** AI agent (Claude) · **Triggered by:** user requested running-log creation after a full planning day

### Planned since last entry

This is the first entry. "Last entry" corresponds to the state immediately before the project was re-opened on 2026-05-07. That baseline: the folder was explicitly *closed* per `PROJECT_CLOSURE.md` (dated 2026-05-07, branch D — "don't build"). Only `STRATEGY.md`, `FEATURE_INVENTORY.md`, and `PROJECT_CLOSURE.md` existed. The closure doc captured four candidate paths (A: 4-week MVP from scratch; B: fork Hoarder/Karakeep; C: single novel primitive; D: don't build). User previously picked D.

On 2026-05-07 user flipped the decision: build the app, but under hard new constraints — **100% local-first, no cloud, sideloadable Android APK, combine all Recall.it + Knowly features thoughtfully, keep version numbers, research first, work from a to-do list**. Name locked to **Brain** initially, then upgraded to **AI Brain** (repo `arunpr614/ai-brain`, public).

Planned outcomes for this session:

1. Author a detailed phased build plan covering all Recall+Knowly features.
2. Research and author a UX/design framework document with both light and dark themes.
3. Stand up project and roadmap trackers so ideas stay sequenced.
4. Kick off the blocking research spikes before writing code.
5. Author a `DESIGN.md` conforming to the `getdesign.md` spec (token-first design contract for AI agents).
6. Create this running log and a reusable skill for future updates.

### Done

**Planning artifacts (sibling folder `Arun_AI_Recall_App/`):**

- `BUILD_PLAN.md` v0.1.1-plan — 14 sections: hard constraints, architecture (laptop = brain, APK = thin-client over LAN), stack (Next.js 15 + better-sqlite3 + sqlite-vec + Ollama + Capacitor 6), 10 phases from v0.1.0 to v0.10.0, feature parity matrix (47 features, 36 shipping pre-v1.0.0, 11 deferred), 4-month cumulative estimate, 9 research spikes, LAN auth posture, risks & kill-switches, directory layout, configurable 6-hour backup policy, design system reference. User-facing decisions (app name, seed corpus, credit UX, backup cadence) resolved in `§12`.
- `DESIGN_SYSTEM.md` v0.1.0-design — operational UX contract. Philosophy = **Structured Calm** (Notion-calm + Linear-keyboard layered). Full Radix Slate + Indigo token set (light + dark), Inter + Charter + JetBrains Mono self-hosted typography, shadcn/ui + Radix Primitives + Lucide component stack, 3-tier elevation, motion rules (80ms/120ms/150ms/300ms), desktop sidebar + mobile bottom-nav IA, 8 per-feature UX sections (capture/organize/consume/ask/generate/review/explore/integrate), accessibility non-negotiables, acceptance checklist for every new screen.
- `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` v0.1.0-tracker — phase status board (all phases `○` except Planning `◐`), 9 research spikes with priority, 4 open decisions, risks watchlist, metrics to track post-v0.1.0.
- `ROADMAP_TRACKER.md` v0.1.0-roadmap — every feature placed in a version lane with lifecycle states (`future → backlog → planned → in-progress → shipped`); deferred items (e.g., Lenny-seed FUT-1) with explicit reopen triggers; dependency + sequencing rationale.
- `DESIGN.md` v0.1.0 — YAML frontmatter with full token set + components table (~70 components defined), then 9 canonical prose sections per the `getdesign.md` spec (Visual Theme, Colors, Typography, Components, Layout, Elevation, Do's/Don'ts, Responsive, Agent Prompt Guide). Deliberately extended with **both light and dark tokens** in frontmatter (the spec's Notion example flagged dark-mode as a known gap).
- `RUNNING_LOG.md` (this file) — append-only project journal.

**Research spikes — 4 kicked off in parallel; 3 of 4 complete at time of writing:**

- `docs/research/lan-auth.md` (R-AUTH, **complete**) — v0.5.0: static bearer token + env-driven LAN binding toggle + auto-generation on first run (one paste from terminal into APK `local.properties`). v0.10.0: QR pairing + Tailscale + TouchID. Dropped options A, B, F, G. Prior art (Home Assistant, Syncthing, Immich) validated the path.
- `docs/research/pdf-extraction.md` (R-PDF, **complete**) — Primary: `unpdf` v1.6.2 (pure TS, unjs ecosystem, built-in metadata, page-count first-class). Fallback: poppler `pdftotext` for two-column arxiv PDFs. `pdf-parse` abandoned; `pdf2json` quality issues. Substack paywall-truncation detectable via `chars-per-page` density check. OCR deferred to future R-OCR phase with `tesseract.js` v7.
- `docs/research/android-share.md` (R-CAP, **complete**) — Plugin: `@capawesome/capacitor-android-share-target` (Robin Genz / capawesome team, maintained, Android 14/15-safe). Intent-filter XML covers `text/plain` + `application/pdf` + `image/*` + `SEND_MULTIPLE`. Cold-start gotcha: also call `ShareTarget.getLastShareData()` in `app/layout.tsx`. AVD testing via `10.0.2.2:3000` alias + `adb shell am start`. Debug keystore + `adb install` sufficient; no App-Link signing ceremony needed. Kotlin fallback sketched (~60 LOC, 3 files).
- `docs/research/llm-sizing.md` (R-LLM, **pending**) — still running in the background.

**Auto-memory stored (so future sessions inherit context):**

- `project_ai_brain.md` — project context, constraints, stack, roadmap
- `user_non_technical_full_ai_assist.md` — full AI-assisted codegen, plain-language explanations
- `reference_mac_hardware.md` — MacBook Pro 16" 2021, M1 Pro, 32 GB, 455 GB free
- Entries added to `MEMORY.md`

**Reusable skill:**

- `~/.claude/skills/running-log-updater/SKILL.md` — skill that always asks the user for the project folder, locates the `RUNNING_LOG.md`, confirms before writing, then appends a structured entry via the Step-4 schema.

### Learned

- **"Structured Calm" as a design philosophy** — hybrid of Things 3 / Reflect / Mem ambient calm as resting state with Linear / Raycast command-surface density as the power layer (`⌘K`). Maps cleanly to all 8 feature categories without layout changes between modes. Derived from a UX-research agent that surveyed Readwise Reader, Obsidian, Notion, Mem, Reflect, Recall.it, Knowly, NotebookLM, Linear, Raycast, Arc, Things 3, Bear, iA Writer.
- **Single-file SQLite with `sqlite-vec` removes the whole "separate vector DB" question** for a personal-scale library — portable, backupable with `cp`, no operational surface.
- **M1 Pro 32 GB is a comfortable LLM ceiling** — Qwen 2.5 7B (q4_K_M) for quality work + Llama 3.2 3B for speed + `nomic-embed-text` for embeddings all fit with slack. No need for API fallback in the default path; API fallback stays opt-in.
- **Android share-sheet integration is the pivotal mobile feature** — without it, the APK is almost pointless. Confirmed the `capawesome` plugin is the right bet and covers Android 14's implicit-intent restrictions cleanly.
- **Substack PDFs silently truncate on paywalls** (prior memory reinforced by R-PDF) — must detect via `totalPages` vs `chars-per-page` density at ingest.
- **Credit UX (Knowly's visible counter) is purely a margin-protection pattern** and has zero place in a local-first app with no inference cost — explicitly dropped.
- **Lenny-seed import is FUT-1, not v0.2.0** — user wants a clean-baseline build, not a pre-loaded corpus. Tooling already exists in `../Lenny_Export/Knowly_import/` if we revisit.
- **getdesign.md spec** — 9 canonical sections, YAML frontmatter carries all tokens + component entries, prose sections reference tokens via `{...}` placeholders. Format is explicitly AI-agent-oriented so codegen can resolve tokens mechanically.
- **Four options dropped for LAN auth:** A (localhost-only blocks mobile), B (open bind, no auth), F (SSH tunnel too technical), G (self-signed TLS too complex pre-v1.0).

### Current remaining to-do

Blocking before v0.1.0 code starts:

1. **R-LLM** research spike lands (in flight) — model choices + `ollama pull` list + disk budget check vs 455 GB free.
2. Synthesize all 4 research outputs into `BUILD_PLAN.md` as concrete dependency choices (plugin names, npm versions, env variables, Ollama tags). A short "§15 Locked-in decisions" section.
3. Move `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` Planning row to `●` and v0.1.0 row to `◐` once all R-* P0 complete.
4. Initialize `arunpr614/ai-brain` **public** GitHub repo and push planning + design + research docs as commit 1 — only after user says go.
5. Scaffold v0.1.0: Next.js 15 + Tailwind 4 + shadcn/ui, SQLite schema, theme toggle, library list, `⌘K` palette stub, backup scheduler (6h default). Exit criteria in `BUILD_PLAN.md` §5 → v0.1.0.

Deferred research (non-blocking for v0.1.0–v0.3.0):

- R-VEC (sqlite-vec perf at 10k+ chunks) — blocks v0.4.0
- R-FSRS (SRS algorithm) — blocks v0.8.0
- R-CLUSTER (topic clustering) — blocks v0.6.0
- R-YT (yt-dlp reliability) — blocks v0.10.0
- R-WHISPER (whisper.cpp vs faster-whisper) — blocks v0.10.0

### Open questions / decisions needed

1. **D-4 Obsidian vault path** — new vault, existing vault, or none. Needed before v0.10.0. Not urgent.
2. Confirm GitHub repo creation ceremony — user said public, on `arunpr614`. Ready when user says go.
3. After R-LLM lands, the final decision on **model set to `ollama pull` on day 1** — likely Qwen 2.5 7B + Llama 3.2 3B + `nomic-embed-text`, confirm against R-LLM benchmarks.
4. First-run PIN vs no PIN on the Mac web UI (separate from LAN token). R-AUTH recommended a PIN with future TouchID path; user hasn't explicitly weighed in.

### State snapshot

- **Current phase / version:** Planning (`◐`) → v0.1.0 Foundation (next)
- **App version:** not yet released; `package.json#version` will start at `0.1.0` when scaffolding lands
- **Plan version:** `v0.1.1-plan`
- **Design doc version:** `v0.1.0-design` (DESIGN_SYSTEM.md) + `v0.1.0` (DESIGN.md)
- **Active trackers:** `BUILD_PLAN.md` · `ROADMAP_TRACKER.md` · `PROJECT_TRACKER.md` · `RUNNING_LOG.md`
- **Research progress:** 3 of 4 P0 spikes complete (R-AUTH, R-PDF, R-CAP); R-LLM in flight
- **Next milestone:** all P0 research spikes done → synthesize decisions into BUILD_PLAN → init `arunpr614/ai-brain` public repo → v0.1.0 scaffolding kickoff
